Adding PHP Censor Support to Your Projects
==========================================

Similar to Travis CI, to support PHP Censor in your project, you simply need to add a `.php-censor.yml` 
(`phpci.yml`/`.phpci.yml` for backward compatibility with PHPCI) file to the root of your repository. The file should 
look something like this:

```yml
build_settings:
  clone_depth: 1 # depth of 1 is a shallow clone, remove this line to clone entire repo
  ignore:
    - "vendor"
    - "tests"
  mysql:
    host: "localhost"
    user: "root"
    pass: ""

setup:
  mysql:
    - "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS test;"
    - "CREATE DATABASE test;"
    - "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO test@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'test';"
  composer:
    action: "install"

test:
  php_unit:
    priority_path: global # Priority path for the search plugin binary (Variants: "local" (Local current build path) | 
                          # "global" (Global PHP Censor 'vendor/bin' path) |
                          # "system" (OS System binaries path, /bin:/usr/bin etc.). 
                          # Default order: local -> global -> system)
    config:
      - "PHPUnit-all.xml"
      - "PHPUnit-ubuntu-fix.xml"
    directory:
      - "tests/"
    run_from: "phpunit/"
    coverage: "tests/logs/coverage"
  php_mess_detector:
    allow_failures: true
  php_code_sniffer:
    standard: "PSR2"
  php_cpd:
    allow_failures: true
  grunt:
    task: "build"

deploy:
  deployer:
    webhook_url: "http://deployer.local/deploy/QZaF1bMIUqbMFTmKDmgytUuykRN0cjCgW9SooTnwkIGETAYhDTTYoR8C431t"
    reason:      "PHP Censor Build #%BUILD% - %COMMIT_MESSAGE%"
    update_only: true

complete:
  mysql:
    host: "localhost"
    user: "root"
    pass: ""
    - "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS test;"

branch-dev:           # Branch-specific config (for "dev" branch)
  run-option: replace # "run-option" parameter can be set to 'replace', 'after' or 'before'
  test:
    grunt:
      task: "build-dev"
```


Stages
------

As mentioned earlier, PHP Censor is powered by plugins, there are several phases in which plugins can be run:

* `setup` - This phase is designed to initialise the build procedure.

* `test` - The tests that should be run during the build. Plugins run during this phase will contribute to the success 
or failure of the build.

* `deploy` - The deploy that should be run after the build. Plugins run during this phase will contribute to the 
success or failure of the build.

* `complete` - Always called when the `test` phase completes, regardless of success or failure. **Note** that is you 
do any DB stuff here, you will need to add the DB credentials to this section as well, as it runs in a separate 
instance.

* `success` - Called upon success of the `test` phase.

* `failure` - Called upon failure of the `test` phase.

* `fixed` - Called upon success of the `test` phase if the previous build of the branch was a failure.

* `broken` - Called upon failure of the `test` phase if the previous build of the branch was a success.

The `ignore` section is merely an array of paths that should be ignored in all tests (where possible).


Branch specific stages
----------------------

PHP Censor allows you configure plugins depending on the branch you configure in the project settings in the UI. 
You can replace a complete stage for a branch, or add extra plugins to a stage that run before or after the default 
plugins.  

### Example config

```yml
test: # Test stage config for all branches
  php_cs_fixer:
    allowed_warnings: -1
success: # Success stage config for all branches
  shell: ./notify

branch-regex:^feature\-\d$:
  run-option: replace
  test:
    php_cs_fixer:
      allowed_warnings: 5

branch-release: # Test config for release branch
  run-option: replace # This can be set to either before, after or replace
  test:

php_cs_fixer:
      allowed_warnings: 0
branch-master: # Test config for release branch
  run-option: after # This can be set to either before, after or replace
  success:
    shell:
      - "rsync ..."
```

### How it works

When you have configured a branch eg "stable" in the project settings in the UI. Add a new config named 
`branch-<branch>` (or use regular expression like: `branch-regex:^stable*`), in this case "branch-stable" to the 
`.php-censor.yml`. In this config, specify all stages and plugins you wish to run.

Also add a new config value `run-option`, that can have 3 values:

* `before` - will cause the branch specific plugins to run before the default ones.
* `after` - will cause the branch specific plugins to run after the default ones.
* `replace` - will cause the branch specific plugins to run and the default ones not.

Useful YAML features
--------------------

Some features of YAML could be very handy. Here is a demonstration of multi line strings, and of anchors and aliases.
See more details on [symfonys yaml document](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.html) on in the [specification](http://yaml.org/spec/1.0/#id2563922).

```yml
setup:
    # yaml comment
    shell:
        - |
            echo a long shell command, multiple lines
            scriptPath=%PROJECT_BUILD_PATH%/../../hook-path/prepare-test5.sh
            if [ -f $scriptPath ]
            then
                "$scriptPath" '%PROJECT%' '%PROJECT_TITLE%' # script can read its path from $scriptPath
                mkdir ../outputs_to_keep/%COMMIT%
            fi
        - >
            echo this is a very long message I must write here, and it is much too long to allow good editing
            on only one line, therefore we break it up onto multiple lines, but the result will be on a single
            line.
        - echo a short command ...

branch-master:
    complete: &xmpp
        xmpp:
            username: &userName "login@gmail.com"
            password: &password "AZERTY123"
            recipients:
                - "builds-infos@jabber.org"
            server: &xmppServer "gtalk.google.com"
            alias: "build infos for project"
            date_format: "%d/%m/%Y"
    broken:
        xmpp:
            username: *userName
            password: *password
            recipients:
                - "build-alters-infos@jabber.org"
            server: *xmppServer
branch-bugfix1.9:
